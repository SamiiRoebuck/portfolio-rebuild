  about: |
    Hey there! I'm Sam, I have recently finished my studies at the University of Leeds and have graduated with a First class degree in Digital Media BA.
    I have a huge passion for technology and development, and love learning about all things code! I have completed a Code First: Girls course in Web development, internships within the development industry and most recently accepted a role as a Graduate Developer.
    My main focus is around modern JavaScript and making cool things on the web and as well as a love of Python coding, check out some of my projects below!
